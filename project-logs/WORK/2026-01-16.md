# WORK LOG

- Date: 2026-01-16
- Session: (optional)
- Scope: admin tooling / dev tools consolidation / UI layout

## Start (mandatory)

- Today focus:
  - Define a persistent logging ritual (work + language).
  - Keep admin tooling changes scoped and reversible.
- Do NOT touch:
  - Unrelated storefront functionality.
  - Production deploy settings (unless explicitly requested).

## Notes (append during work)

- Implemented a daily logs routine stored in-repo (not in `.windsurf/`) because `.windsurf/` is gitignored and blocked for writes.
- Created:
  - `project-workflows/logs.md`
  - `project-workflows/templates/log-work.md`
  - `project-workflows/templates/log-language.md`
  - `project-logs/LANGUAGE/2026-01-16.md`
  - `project-logs/WORK/2026-01-16.md`

## End (mandatory)

### What changed

- Added an in-repo logging routine + templates.
- Stored the Catalan grammar rule log under `project-logs/LANGUAGE/2026-01-16.md`.

### Still open / unknown

- Need a reliable way to enforce reading logs at session start (procedural: assistant must always open latest logs first).
- Decide whether logs should be committed to git or kept local-only (gitignored).

### Next session (first actions)

- Read latest `project-logs/WORK/*.md` and `project-logs/LANGUAGE/*.md`.
- Create today's files if missing.
- Continue with admin scroll elimination + ruleta tool recovery.
